## 🚀 What You Need to Do Now

### Choose ONE method:

### Option 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended - No Windows Needed!)

Since you're in a Linux dev container, this is the easiest:

```bash
# 1. Push the new files (already committed)
git push

# 2. Create and push version tag
git tag v1.0.1
git push origin v1.0.1

# 3. Watch it work!
# Go to: https://github.com/albert9f/TFT-sleep-tracker/actions
```

**Time: ~7 minutes (automated)**  
**Requirements: Just GitHub**

---

### Option 2: Windows Machine (If You Have One)

```powershell
# 1. Pull latest code
git pull

# 2. Run release script
.\scripts\release-1.0.1.ps1 -Upload

# 3. Done!
```

**Time: ~10 minutes (mostly automated)**  
**Requirements: Windows with .NET 8 SDK**

## ✅ What This Fixes

### Before:
❌ v1.0.1 release has only `TFTSleepTracker.exe`  
❌ No `RELEASES` file  
❌ No Squirrel packages  
❌ Users on 1.0.0 **cannot** auto-update  

### After:
✅ v1.0.1 release has proper Squirrel packages  
✅ `RELEASES` file present  
✅ `Setup.exe` and `.nupkg` files included  
✅ Users on 1.0.0 **will** auto-update within 7 days  

---

## 📊 Expected Results

Once you create the proper v1.0.1 release:

1. **New users**: Download `Setup.exe` and install
2. **Existing users on 1.0.0**:
   - App checks for updates (every 7 days)
   - Finds v1.0.1 in `RELEASES` file
   - Downloads delta package (~200-500 KB)
   - Updates on next restart
   - **No manual action needed!** 🎉

**Average rollout time: 3-7 days**
