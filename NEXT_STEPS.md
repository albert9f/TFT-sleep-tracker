# 🎯 YOUR NEXT STEPS - SIMPLE & CLEAR

## ✅ What I Just Did For You

I created **everything you need** to release version 1.0.1 with proper Squirrel packages so users on 1.0.0 can auto-update.

**Status**: ✅ All files created and committed locally

---

## 🚀 What YOU Need To Do Now (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

```bash
git push
```

This uploads all the new documentation and GitHub Actions workflow.

---

### Step 2: Create Version Tag

```bash
git tag v1.0.1
```

This tags your current code as version 1.0.1.

---

### Step 3: Push the Tag

```bash
git push origin v1.0.1
```

This triggers the GitHub Actions workflow that will:
- ✅ Build your app on a Windows VM (automatic)
- ✅ Run tests (automatic)
- ✅ Create Squirrel packages (automatic)
- ✅ Upload to GitHub Releases (automatic)

**Time: ~7 minutes**

---

## 📊 What Will Happen

### Immediately After Step 3:

1. GitHub Actions starts automatically
2. You can watch progress at:
   ```
   https://github.com/albert9f/TFT-sleep-tracker/actions
   ```

### After ~7 minutes:

3. Release v1.0.1 is created with:
   - `Setup.exe` (installer)
   - `RELEASES` (manifest for auto-updates)
   - `*.nupkg` files (Squirrel packages)

4. Check it here:
   ```
   https://github.com/albert9f/TFT-sleep-tracker/releases/tag/v1.0.1
   ```

### Within 7 Days:

5. Users on version 1.0.0 will:
   - Auto-detect the update
   - Download it in the background
   - Apply it on next restart
   - **No manual action needed!**

---

## 💻 Copy-Paste Commands

Just copy and paste these three commands:

```bash
# Step 1: Push files
git push

# Step 2: Create tag
git tag v1.0.1

# Step 3: Push tag (triggers GitHub Actions)
git push origin v1.0.1
```

**That's it! You're done!** 🎉

## 🔍 How to Verify

### 1. Check GitHub Actions
```
https://github.com/albert9f/TFT-sleep-tracker/actions

### 2. Check Release (after ~7 minutes)
```
https://github.com/albert9f/TFT-sleep-tracker/releases/tag/v1.0.1
```
✅ Should have: Setup.exe, RELEASES, *.nupkg files

### 3. Download and Test (optional)
- Download `Setup.exe`
- Run on a Windows machine
- Verify it installs correctly

## ❓ What If Something Goes Wrong?

### GitHub Actions fails?

1. Go to: https://github.com/albert9f/TFT-sleep-tracker/actions
2. Click on the failed run
3. Check the error logs
4. Common fixes:
   - Tests failed? Fix tests and re-tag
   - Build failed? Check error in logs
   - Most issues are shown clearly in logs

## 🎓 Understanding What You're Doing

### Why `git push`?
Uploads your new files (documentation, scripts, GitHub Actions workflow) to GitHub.

### Why `git tag v1.0.1`?
Tags your current commit as version 1.0.1. This is used to identify releases.

### Why `git push origin v1.0.1`?
Triggers the GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds and releases your app.

---

## 🔄 For Future Releases (1.0.2, 1.0.3, etc.)

Same three commands, just change the version:

```bash
git push
git tag v1.0.2
git push origin v1.0.2
```

**Everything is automated!** No need to repeat the setup.
