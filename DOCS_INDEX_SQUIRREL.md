## 📞 Quick Answers

### "Will users on 1.0.0 get 1.0.1 automatically?"
**After you create a proper Squirrel release:** YES! Within 7 days.  
**With current .exe-only release:** NO.  
→ Read `RELEASE_STRUCTURE_EXPLAINED.md` to understand why.

### "Which method should I use?"
**No Windows machine?** → GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/README.md`)  
**Have Windows?** → PowerShell (`RELEASE_1.0.1_QUICK_START.md`)  
**Both work!** Same result either way.

### "Is it complicated?"
**No!** It's either:
- `git tag v1.0.1 && git push origin v1.0.1` (GitHub Actions)
- `.\scripts\release-1.0.1.ps1 -Upload` (PowerShell)

→ Read `RELEASE_1.0.1_QUICK_START.md` for proof!

### "What if something goes wrong?"
Check troubleshooting sections in:
- `RELEASE_1.0.1_CHECKLIST.md`
- `scripts/manual-release-guide.md`
- `.github/workflows/README.md`

### "Can I test before releasing?"
**Yes!** Run script without `-Upload` flag:
```powershell
.\scripts\release-1.0.1.ps1
```
Files go to `dist/` folder. Test locally, then upload manually.
