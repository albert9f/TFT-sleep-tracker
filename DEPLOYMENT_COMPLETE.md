## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If client reports issues:

### Red Error Message After Test
- Check the error text (now shows actual HTTP errors)
- Common: "No connection could be made..." = firewall blocking
- Common: "HTTP 422..." = server validation error
- Common: "Timeout" = server unreachable

### App Won't Start
- Ensure Windows 10/11 x64
- Try running as Administrator
- Check Windows Event Viewer for errors

### Delete Settings (Reset)
If needed, delete:
```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\TFTSleepTracker\settings.json
```
