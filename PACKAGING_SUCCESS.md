## 💡 Pro Tips

### Speed Up Development Builds

```powershell
# Skip tests for faster iteration
.\pack-squirrel.ps1 -Version "1.0.0-dev" -SkipTests
```

### Understand What's Happening

```powershell
# Use simple script to see core commands
.\pack-simple.ps1 -Version "1.0.0"
```

### Automate Releases

```powershell
# One command to build and publish
.\pack-squirrel.ps1 -Version "1.0.0" -Upload
```

### Test Before Distributing

Always test on a clean Windows VM to catch:
- Missing dependencies
- Installation issues
- First-run problems
- Autostart functionality

### Keep Paths Short

Move repository to short path to avoid Windows 260-char limit:
```
❌ C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Projects\Company\TFT-sleep-tracker\
✅ C:\code\TFT\
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### "squirrel: command not found"
```powershell
dotnet tool install --global Squirrel
# Restart PowerShell
```

### Tests fail
```powershell
.\pack-squirrel.ps1 -Version "1.0.0" -SkipTests
```

### Build errors
```powershell
.\diagnose.ps1
# Check output for issues
```

### Path too long
```powershell
# Move repo to C:\code\TFT\
```

### Complete reset
```powershell
Remove-Item ..\dist, ..\nupkgs -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
dotnet clean
.\pack-squirrel.ps1 -Version "1.0.0"
```
